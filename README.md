# MoveAround

Somehow bored and interestingly not willing to play my saxophone this evening, having some messy dirs to tidy up a bit, i decided to try writing a small bash script to move files into subdirs.

Nothing special at all, but I must put all my small scripts online if I don't want to loose them in my confused directory tree.

So.
